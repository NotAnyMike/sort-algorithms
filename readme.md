# Instructions

1. Create your own branch
2. Modify only your algorithm 
3. Check if you algorith works (it should say "it worked ...." when you run `python main.py`)
4. Push the commit with the changes
5. Go to github as create a Pull Request
6. Let me do the rest

## The main problem with the algorithms
* They order the numbers in the right way but they skip ignore one number, the initial size of the vector is 1000, the restuls must the same size
